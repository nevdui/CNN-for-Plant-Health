//! The `GhostBorrowMut` trait, which allows mutably borrowing multiple `GhostCell`s simultaneously.
//!
//! This module implement the `GhostBorrowMut` trait for:
//!
//! -   A slice of `GhostCell`s.
//! -   An array of `GhostCell`s of any size.
//! -   A tuple of `GhostCell`s of up to 12 elements.
//! -   A tuple of references to `GhostCell`s of up to 12 elements.
//!
//! #   Performance
//!
//! In general borrowing is free of cost, however a special-case is necessary for the tuple of references, as then the
//! references may alias.
//!
//! #   Experimental
//!
//! The feature is experimental, to enable, use the feature "experimental-multiple-mutable-borrows".
